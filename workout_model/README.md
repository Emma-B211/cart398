We had about 8 classes. Pictures taken by ourselves.  We took even more pictures of different exercises but because of the very short time we decided to not put too many as we didn't have the time to tweak. 

The classes were : 
- Squats 
- Push ups 
- Plank
- Elevated Crunches 
- No One
- Idle 
- Sit ups  (disabled)
- Curl ups  (disabled)
- Dips (disabled)
- Burpees (disabled)
- Mountain Climb (disabled)


 We had around 40 minimum images per class except for two  that had 20 images 

Number of epochs was set to 100, with a learning rate of 0.001
